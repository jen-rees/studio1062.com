            <h2>Overview</h2>         
                <p>The City of Trinidad has a staff of five full-time and six part-time employees, and this includes the officers and staff of the Police Department.  Many of the functions of the City are contracted to professional private firms, including Planning and Building, Engineering, Legal (City Attorney), and Finance/Accounting.</p>

            <h2>Police Department</h2>
            <p>In July, 2010, the law enforcement responsibilities of the Trinidad Police Department were transferred to the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office via a contract with the County Board of Supervisors.  A full-time deputy is assigned to Trinidad, and roving patrols are provided by the Sheriff at times when the deputy is not on duty.  Emergency situations should still be handled by a call to 911 Emergency Services.</p>
            <p>Deputy Scott Hicks is assigned to Trinidad.  He can be reached at the old location of the Trinidad Police Department at 463 Trinity Street.  His hours vary.  Complaints can still be filed at that location, and the phone number to call that office is 677-0133.  The office is normally open from 9:00am until 3:00pm, Mondays through Fridays.</p>
            <p>The Police Department still issues dog licenses to pet owners within the City limits.  In 2011, dog licenses in Trinidad are $5.00 to $20.00, depending on whether the dog has been neutered.  Animal control services are provided by Humboldt County</p>

            <h2>Volunteer Fire Department</h2>          
            <p>The Trinidad Volunteer Fire Department (TVFD) provides fire protection services within the City limits.  The Department also provides services in the adjacent communities through a mutual aide agreement with Cal Fire.  As of mid-2009 the Department had ten volunteers.  The City-owned fire station houses two 1000 gallons per minute pumpers and a rescue vehicle.</p>
            <p>In addition to fire protection services, the TVFD also offers emergency medical services. Most of the Volunteers are trained as first responders or Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT's). The Department's emergency medical vehicle is stocked with a defibrillator and a large array of life saving rescue equipment.</p>
            <p>Requests for emergency assistance are typically forwarded from the regional 911 emergency center to the Volunteers by pagers and a large siren on top of the fire station. Volunteers are on call 24-7 and respond to about 50 calls per year. Response time is typically excellent. Any city residents with medical training who wish to volunteer are encouraged to contact the City Clerk at City Hall for an application.</p>
            <p>
The Chief of the Trinidad Volunteer Fire Department is Tom Marquette. He has been with the department since 1986. He can be reached at (707) 677-0224 or by email at tvfdchief@gmail.com. Calls for emergencies should be made to 911.</p>

            <h2>Public Works Department</h2>         
            <p>The primary function of the Public Works Department is to maintain the public streets and roads within the City limits. This is done as efficiently as possible in consideration of safety needs and a limited budget. Major improvements to the City streets system usually relies on State or federal grant opportunities. The Department also maintains the publicly owned grounds and buildings with a full and part-time staff. Public grounds include the local trails system, much of Trinidad Head, lands at the waterfront, and incidental small properties throughout the City.</p>
            <p>In late 2008, the City Council adopted an Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems ordinance.  This ordinance, while not yet implemented, will establish a septic system maintenance program for property owners in the City.  Septic systems exist throughout the City because there is no central sewage collection or treatment system.</p>
            <p>The first City Park is planned to be constructed at the site of the Trinidad Cultural Center.  “Saunders Park” will be adjacent to the new Trinidad Museum and the new Trinidad Library, and it will be maintained by the Public Works Department.</p>
            <p>Any complaints or specific requests for services related to the functions of the Public Works Department should be directed through the City Clerk at (707) 677-0223.</p>

                <h2>Water Department</h2>
                <p>Trinidad maintains a public water system for residents, businesses, and public users within the City limits and for many customers adjacent to the City.  The Water Treatment facility runs continually to provide water that meets state and federal standards at a reasonable cost to its customers.  The water distribution system is older in many areas, but the staff works cooperatively to assure that any leaks are detected and repaired as quickly as possible.  This includes periodic meter testing for residents as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
    The system also includes two water tanks that help to control pressure, provide a sack-up supply in periods of high demand, and meet the fire flow requirements when emergencies arise.
                </p>
                <p>
    There is a limited demand for new water connections due to the small amount of urban growth that is experienced in the City on an annual basis.  At this time, no additional connections are permitted outside of the City limits.
                </p>
                <p>
    Water rates are set in a manner to meet the ongoing operational costs, retire any debts that the system experiences, and to provide an ongoing reasonable reserve fund for emergencies and system improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
    The Director of the City’s Water Department is Bryan Buckman.   He has been with the City since May, 1999.  He can be reached at (707) 677-3862 or by email at

There are a limited amount of burial sites still available for sale to the public.  City staff maintains the grounds of the Trinidad Cemetery.  While the City does not arrange funeral services at the cemetery, the coordination of burial and the preparation of gravesites is a City responsibility.</p>
